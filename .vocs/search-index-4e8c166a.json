Also if you lack computing power and have access to pre-ranked list, this solution can be your best option.\nClearly define the question your are trying to address and choose the appropriate ranking metrics.\nGenes sets curation could be useful as a pre-processing step. Indeed you do not need to perform test on genes set you are not interested in. It will increase your need for computing resources and create supplementary noise for the Adjustment of Multiple Hypothesis Testing procedure.\n\n","title":"The Method","titles":["A quick overview of Gene sets enrichment analysis","Principles"]},"16":{"href":"/blog/gsea#to-go-further-with-theory","html":"\n<p>There exists a variant of GSEA called FGSEA for <u>F</u>ast <u>G</u>ene <u>S</u>et <u>E</u>nrichment <u>A</u>nalysis.<br/></p>\n<p>Another common approach to perform pathways analysis is the <a href=\"https://geneontology.org/docs/go-enrichment-analysis/\">Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis</a>.</p>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nThere exists a variant of GSEA called FGSEA for Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.\nAnother common approach to perform pathways analysis is the Gene Ontology Enrichment analysis.\n","title":"To go further with theory","titles":["A quick overview of Gene sets enrichment analysis","Principles"]},"17":{"href":"/blog/gsea#available-programs-for-practice","html":"\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/downloads.jsp\">Official Broad institute tools</a></li>\n<li><strong>WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.webgestalt.org/\">GUI</a>\n<a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WebGestaltR/index.html\">R package</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fgsea.html\">Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</a> (Pre-ranked only)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<section data-footnotes=\"true\" class=\"footnotes\">","isPage":false,"text":"\n\nOfficial Broad institute tools\nWEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit\nGUI\nR package\nFast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Pre-ranked only)\n\n\n","title":"Available programs for practice","titles":["A quick overview of Gene sets enrichment analysis"]},"18":{"href":"/blog/gsea#footnote-label","html":"\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n<p>Timothy E.
