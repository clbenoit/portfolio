## Why this app

DNA methylation profiling has become a cornerstone of modern molecular pathology,  
especially for tumor classification, where reference classifiers (notably those developed at the DKFZ) have profoundly changed diagnostic practices.

For many years, access to these analyses was facilitated by the availability of **free, centralized, online tools**  
<a href="#ref-1" class="vocs_Anchor">[1]</a>.  
This model enabled rapid dissemination, harmonization of practices, and massive community adoption.

However, recent shifts towards **restricted access, licensing models, or commercial spin-offs**  
<a href="#ref-2" class="vocs_Anchor">[2]</a> <a href="#ref-3" class="vocs_Anchor">[3]</a>  
have revealed a structural weakness of this approach:  
many laboratories have become **dependent on external infrastructures** for a core diagnostic activity.

As with variant analysis, outsourcing methylome analysis is often driven by:

- Limited local bioinformatics resources.
- The complexity of maintaining up-to-date analytical pipelines.
- Regulatory and administrative constraints in clinical environments.

While understandable, this strategy raises long-term issues:

- Loss of autonomy over data and methods.
- Rising costs for tools that were historically community-driven.
- Stagnation of local expertise, despite increasing methodological complexity.

MethylDB was born from this observation.

## Project philosophy

MethylDB aims to provide a **local, transparent, and extensible solution** for the exploration of DNA methylation results,  
without relying on external black-box services.

The goal is **not** to replace existing classifiers or pipelines,  
but to **re-internalize the interpretation layer**, which is where most of the added value for biologists actually lies.

In short:

- Pipelines can remain standardized (nf-core, in-house, or commercial).
- Raw or processed methylation outputs remain within the institution.
- Interpretation, comparison, annotation, and curation are performed locally.

This mirrors the same logic that motivated the development of GermlineVarDB.

## What MethylDB does

MethylDB is designed to:

- Import DNA methylation results (e.g. IDAT-derived matrices, classifier outputs, QC metrics).
- Build a **local methylation database** across samples, projects, and time.
- Provide a **graphical interface** to:
  - Explore sample similarity and clustering.
  - Inspect classifier scores and confidence metrics.
  - Compare new cases to historical local cohorts.
  - Flag ambiguous or borderline classifications.

The focus is deliberately on **usability for molecular biologists and pathologists**,  
not on replacing notebooks or command-line workflows.

## Open-source and community-driven

MethylDB is released as an **open-source project**, with the same conviction as my previous work:  
tools used daily in diagnostics should be understandable, auditable, and improvable by their users.

- [Source code](https://github.com/clbenoit/MethylDB)
- Live demo (coming soon)

The project is intentionally modular, allowing users to adapt it to:

- Different array technologies.
- Different classifiers or reference datasets.
- Research versus routine diagnostic contexts.


## Call for contributions

If you are:

- A laboratory affected by recent changes in access to methylome classifiers,
- A bioinformatician tired of re-implementing the same internal tools,
- Or simply interested in open and sustainable molecular diagnostics,

then contributions, feedback, and discussions are more than welcome.
