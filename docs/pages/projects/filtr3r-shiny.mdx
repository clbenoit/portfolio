## Why this app

FiLT3r is a lightweight, alignment-free algorithm designed to detect, characterize, and quantify FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITDs) from high-throughput sequencing data, enabling accurate risk stratification and follow-up in [acute myeloid leukemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia) (AML).

While powerful, command-line tools remain a barrier for many users, particularly biologists and clinicians who are not familiar with R scripting. In practice, this often leads to:

- A strong dependency on bioinformaticians for routine analyses  
- Limited exploration of parameter space due to usability constraints  
- Reduced reproducibility when analyses are manually adapted  

The **FilLT3r Shiny App** was developed to address these issues by providing an intuitive graphical interface that encapsulates the original FilLT3r tool.

## Objectives

The main goals of this application are to:

- Make FilLT3r accessible to non-programmers  
- Enable interactive parameter tuning and immediate feedback  
- Improve transparency and reproducibility of filtering strategies  
- Facilitate data exploration prior to downstream analyses  

By lowering the technical barrier, this application allows users to focus on biological interpretation rather than implementation details.

## What it does

FilLT3r Shiny App provides:

- Interactive loading of input datasets  
- Graphical configuration of FilLT3r filtering parameters  
- Real-time visualization of filtering effects  
- Export of filtered datasets for downstream analyses  

The application strictly relies on the underlying FilLT3r methodology, ensuring consistency with the original published approach.
