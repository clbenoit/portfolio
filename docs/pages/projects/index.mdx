# Here are my projects

## OmicsVerse

The initial aim of the  [OmicsVerse portal](https://omicsverse.fr) is to host demo versions of the various data applications I create. 

Application source code and documentation for administrators can be found on my [github](https://github.com/clbenoit).

The following sections & pages will host detailed documentation of users.

If you have a genomics-oriented data application to host, don't hesitate to contact me. provided there are resources available.

- [SomaVarDB](somavardb)

- [GermlineVarDB](germlinevardb)

- [FilLT3r Shiny App](filtr3r-shiny)

- [Methyldb](methyldb)

### Can I use it for clinical purposes?

The honest answer is: **not yet**.

These are **research and exploratory tools**.  
Using it in routine diagnostics would require compliance with  
medical device software regulations and formal validation processes

This is far beyond what a single developer can realistically achieve alone this is an unattainable goal for just one person in their spare time.  <br/><br/>
So if you feel like contributing to the project. Don't hesitate to contact me :
[benoitclement.data@gmail.com](mailto:benoitclement.data@gmail.com).

That said, these tools are designed to **lower the barrier** for institutions that want to:

- Reclaim control over their methylation data.
- Prepare internal validation efforts.
- Build collective expertise instead of outsourcing it.
