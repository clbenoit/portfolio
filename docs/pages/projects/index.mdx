# Here are my projects

## OmicsVerse

The initial aim of the  [OmicsVerse portal](https://omicsverse.fr) is to host demo versions of the various data applications I create. 

Application source code and documentation for administrators can be found on my [github](https://github.com/clbenoit).

The following sections & pages will host detailed documentation of users.

If you have a genomics-oriented data application to host, don't hesitate to contact me. provided there are resources available.
