## Why this app

LRM_Elembio is an open-source tool designed to simplify the creation of **Manifest files** required for planning sequencing runs on AVITI platforms by **Elements Bioscience**. Manifest files must follow a strict format, which can be challenging to generate manually, especially when matching sample well positions with barcoded indexes.

In practice, manual Manifest creation often results in:

- Errors due to mismatched sample positions or indexes  
- A heavy reliance on bioinformaticians for routine sequencing setup  
- Slower workflow integration in clinical or research pipelines  

The **LRM_Elembio** app addresses these issues by providing an intuitive interface that streamlines Manifest generation.

## Objectives

The main goals of LRM_Elembio are to:

- Enable non-programmers, including lab technicians and clinicians, to generate Manifests  
- Automate the mapping between flowcell well positions and sample indexes  
- Reduce errors and improve reproducibility in run setup  
- Facilitate integration of AVITI sequencing into routine workflows  

By lowering the technical barrier, users can focus on experimental design and sample tracking rather than file formatting.

## What it does

LRM_Elembio provides:

- Interactive loading of sample metadata  
- Automatic mapping of samples to AVITI flowcell positions  
- Validation of Manifest file format against Elements Bioscience specifications  
- Export of ready-to-use Manifest files for direct upload to the AVITI instrument  

The application ensures that all generated files are compliant with AVITI requirements while keeping the interface accessible and user-friendly.
