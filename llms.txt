- [Circular RNAs and immune regulation in lung biology: a conceptual overview](/portfolio/blog/circRNAs): During my recent work in transcriptomics and bioinformatics,
I have had the opportunity to engage with projects exploring the role of non-coding RNA in lung biology and immune regulation.\
While I cannot share unpublished results due to confidentiality, I can provide an overview of the **biological concepts** that frame this type of research.
- [How data analysis can help to fix genetic disorders](/portfolio/blog/cutonestrand): Gene therapy as seen a major breakthrough with the development of **CRISPR-Cas9** technology.
This revolutionary tool allows scientists to precisely edit genes, offering new hope for
treating genetic disorders and diseases. **With the potential to correct genetic mutations at
the source, CRISPR-Cas9 opens up a world of possibilities for personalized medicine and targeted therapies.**
The future of gene therapy looks brighter than ever,
with the promise of improved treatments and even potential cures for a wide range of conditions.
- [Experimental design in the context of next generation sequencing](/portfolio/blog/expdesign): Coming from a biotechnology background, I was sensitized to the problems of experimental design. I then spent a few years as a bioinformatician, leaving this task to my platform colleagues.
- [Methodology](/portfolio/blog/expdesign): **Clearly define the question posed and the technology chosen to answer it.** <br />
Many confounding factors will depend on the technology chosen. They will have a greater or lesser impact depending on the question asked.
- [Conclusion](/portfolio/blog/expdesign): **Clearly define the question posed and the technology chosen to answer it.** <br />
Many confounding factors will depend on the technology chosen. They will have a greater or lesser impact depending on the question asked.
- [A quick overview of Gene sets enrichment analysis](/portfolio/blog/gsea): Genome wide expression analysis has become become a mainstay of genomics research. However, there is still a wide range of tools for interpreting these gene expression profiles.
They all have pros, cons, and are still evolving. This, coupled with the fact that these studies rely on the testing of a large number of hypotheses and relatively small sample sizes, lead that whole-genome expression studies in particular, to be often not reproducible.
This is why reproducibility is one of the major challenges facing studies involving whole-genome expression data
